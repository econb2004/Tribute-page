                    Senator Chris Nwabueze Ngige OON, former Governor of Anambra State and Senator representing Anambra Central Senatorial
                    District under the Action Congress of Nigeria (ACN), was born on August 8, 1952, into the family of Chief Pius (Akunnia)
                    and <strong> Late Mrs Pricillia Ngige</strong> of Alor Town in Anambra State's Idemili South Local Government Area. Anambra State, and
                    Ndigbo in general, are currently mired in a political quagmire caused by ineffective leadership. </p>

                    <p>It is regrettable that Anambra State, which has produced such luminaries as Dr. Nnamdi Azikiwe, Dr. Nwafor Orizu, Sir
                    Louis Mbanefo, Sir Louis Ojukwu, his tireless son, Emeka Ojukwu, Dr. Alex Ekwueme, Jerome Udorji, Mokwugo Okoye,
                    Cardinal Francis Arinze, Chuba Okadigbo, The people of Anambra, and by extension the Ndigbo, long for a purposeful and compassionate leader. A leader who is proud of his heritage without being tribalistic, and who has a significant
                    following, in order to gain his people's support, bring them along, and reintegrate them into national politics. Dr Chris Ngige, with his <strong> excellent courage</strong>, astuteness, doggedness, and experience, was adjudged most suited to
                    represent the Anambra Central senatorial zone, resulting in his election to the senate, despite the massive bottleneck
                    placed in his path to the senate.</p>
